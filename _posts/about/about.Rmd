Hi, my name is Shawn Lemaire and I'm here to teach you some great things about science, and more specifically biology. It's a passion that I developed when I was very young because my parents loved and still love animals. I began to observe them, to take an interest in them. So I started studying biology at the University of Mons.

Then, my SDD teacher and my English teacher joined forces against me and I am now writing articles on a subject I chose recently.

But I don't blame them because it's really the best way to improve my English and for me as well as for you to discover new things about the world around us.
So take your microscope and your vials, we are going to a wonderful new world, the world of biology!
