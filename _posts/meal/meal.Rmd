## September 2020
* I have downloaded Speaky for a few weeks, that is an app created to speak with some others people around the world and I am talking with many people now, I try to open the app every days or one day out of two.
* My entire smartphone is in English and I am going to let it like that for a few years.
* I am now following many anglophone Facebook pages.

## October 2020
* I read many press articles about news items.
* I often watch some videos or series in English.

## November 2020
* I am always on Speaky, so...
* In my article research for the english course, I have to read carefully many science articles and sometimes, when I find an article title attractive, even if it is not about my subject, I open the page.
